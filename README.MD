# Introduction
This is a tool that is used to build real-time [SA-MP](http://sa-mp.com) server signatures.

I made this tool back in 2014 and released it, didn't open sourced it though, on SA-MP forum in 2015 but it was buggy at that time so didn't catch any attention, I fixed major bugs recently so decided to release it.

As I wrote this code when I was a newb to web development, so the code may not be written in the best manner can probably be optimized/improved.

Works best with google chrome, didn't test with firefox and I am pretty sure it won't work with edge/IE.
